                  "value": "The color is based on the midpoint of the layer, except for extended end layers.  By default, the norm vmin and vmax are the extreme values of the non-extended levels.  Hence, the layer color extremes are not the extreme values of the colormap itself, but approach those values as the number of levels increases.  An advantage of this scheme is that line contours, when added to filled contours, take on colors that are consistent with those of the filled regions; for example, a contour line on the boundary between two regions will have a color intermediate between those of the regions."
