It is true, by definition, that every tree/arborescence is spanning with respect to the nodes that define the tree/arborescence and so, it might seem redundant to introduce the notion of \"spanning\". However, the nodes may represent a subset of nodes from a larger graph, and it is in this context that the term \"spanning\" becomes a useful notion."
