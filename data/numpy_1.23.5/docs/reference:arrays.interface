The optional\n   keys in the dictionary have implied defaults if they are not\n   provided.\n\n   The keys are:\n\n   **shape** (required)\n       Tuple whose elements are the array size in each dimension. Each\n       entry is an integer (a Python :py:class:`int`).  Note that these\n       integers could be larger than the platform ``int`` or ``long``\n       could hold (a Python :py:class:`int` is a C ``long``). It is up to the code\n       using this attribute to handle this appropriately; either by\n       raising an error when overflow is possible, or by using\n       ``long long`` as the C type for the shapes.\n\n   **typestr** (required)\n       A string providing the basic type of the homogeneous array The\n       basic string format consists of 3 parts: a character describing\n       the byteorder of the data (``<``: little-endian, ``>``:\n       big-endian, ``|``: not-relevant), a character code giving the\n       basic type of the array, and an integer providing the number of\n       bytes the type uses.\n\n       The basic type character codes are:\n\n       =====  ================================================================\n       ``t``  Bit field (following integer gives the number of\n              bits in the bit field).\n       ``b``  Boolean (integer type where all values are only ``True`` or\n              ``False``)\n       ``i``  Integer\n       ``u``  Unsigned integer\n       ``f``  Floating point\n       ``c``  Complex floating point\n       ``m``  Timedelta\n       ``M``  Datetime\n       ``O``  Object (i.e. the memory contains a pointer to :c:type:`PyObject`)\n       ``S``  String (fixed-length sequence of char)\n       ``U``  Unicode (fixed-length sequence of :c:type:`Py_UCS4`)\n       ``V``  Other (void \\* -- each item is a fixed-size chunk of memory)\n       =====  ================================================================\n\n   **descr** (optional)\n       A list of tuples providing a more detailed description of the\n       memory layout for each item in the homogeneous array.  Each\n       tuple in the list has two or three elements.  Normally, this\n       attribute would be used when *typestr* is ``V[0-9]+``, but this is\n       not a requirement.  The only requirement is that the number of\n       bytes represented in the *typestr* key is the same as the total\n       number of bytes represented here.  The idea is to support\n       descriptions of C-like structs that make up array\n       elements.  The elements of each tuple in the list are\n\n       1.  A string providing a name associated with this portion of\n           the datatype.  This could also be a tuple of ``('full name',\n\t   'basic_name')`` where basic name would be a valid Python\n           variable name representing the full name of the field.\n\n       2. Either a basic-type description string as in *typestr* or\n          another list (for nested structured types)\n\n       3. An optional shape tuple providing how many times this part\n          of the structure should be repeated.  No repeats are assumed\n          if this is not given.  Very complicated structures can be\n          described using this generic interface.  Notice, however,\n          that each element of the array is still of the same\n          data-type.  Some examples of using this interface are given\n          below.\n\n       **Default**: ``[('', typestr)]``\n\n   **data** (optional)\n       A 2-tuple whose first argument is a :doc:`Python integer <python:c-api/long>`\n       that points to the data-area storing the array contents.\n\n       .. note::\n          When converting from C/C++ via ``PyLong_From*`` or high-level\n          bindings such as Cython or pybind11, make sure to use an integer\n          of sufficiently large bitness.\n\n       This pointer must point to the first element of\n       data (in other words any offset is always ignored in this\n       case). The second entry in the tuple is a read-only flag (true\n       means the data area is read-only).\n\n       This attribute can also be an object exposing the\n       :ref:`buffer interface <bufferobjects>` which\n       will be used to share the data. If this key is not present (or\n       returns None), then memory sharing will be done\n       through the buffer interface of the object itself.  In this\n       case, the offset key can be used to indicate the start of the\n       buffer.  A reference to the object exposing the array interface\n       must be stored by the new object if the memory area is to be\n       secured.\n\n       **Default**: ``None``\n\n   **strides** (optional)\n       Either ``None`` to indicate a C-style contiguous array or\n       a tuple of strides which provides the number of bytes needed\n       to jump to the next array element in the corresponding\n       dimension. Each entry must be an integer (a Python\n       :py:class:`int`). As with shape, the values may\n       be larger than can be represented by a C ``int`` or ``long``; the\n       calling code should handle this appropriately, either by\n       raising an error, or by using ``long long`` in C. The\n       default is ``None`` which implies a C-style contiguous\n       memory buffer. In this model, the last dimension of the array\n       varies the fastest.  For example, the default strides tuple\n       for an object whose array entries are 8 bytes long and whose\n       shape is ``(10, 20, 30)`` would be ``(4800, 240, 8)``.\n\n       **Default**: ``None`` (C-style contiguous)\n\n   **mask** (optional)\n       ``None`` or an object exposing the array interface.  All\n       elements of the mask array should be interpreted only as true\n       or not true indicating which elements of this array are valid.\n       The shape of this object should be `\"broadcastable\"\n       <arrays.broadcasting.broadcastable>` to the shape of the\n       original array.\n\n       **Default**: ``None`` (All array values are valid)\n\n   **offset** (optional)\n       An integer offset into the array data region. This can only be\n       used when data is ``None`` or returns a :class:`buffer`\n       object.\n\n       **Default**: ``0``.\n\n   **version** (required)\n       An integer showing the version of the interface (i.e. 3 for\n       this version).  Be careful not to use this to invalidate\n       objects exposing future versions of the interface."
