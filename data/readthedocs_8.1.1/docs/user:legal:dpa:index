In case of any conflict or inconsistency with the terms of the Agreement, this DPA shall take precedence over the terms of the Agreement to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency. If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA shall not be affected.
