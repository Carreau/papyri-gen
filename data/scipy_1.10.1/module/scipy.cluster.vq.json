The k-means algorithm tries to minimize distortion, which is defined as the sum of the squared distances between each observation vector and its dominating centroid. The minimization is achieved by iteratively reclassifying the observations into clusters and recalculating the centroids until a configuration is reached in which the centroids are stable. One can also define a maximum number of iterations."

By using a smaller 8-bit encoding, we can reduce the amount of data by two thirds. Ideally, the colors for each of the 256 possible 8-bit encoding values should be chosen to minimize distortion of the color. Running k-means with k=256 generates a code book of 256 codes, which fills up all possible 8-bit sequences. Instead of sending a 3-byte value for each pixel, the 8-bit centroid index (or code word) of the dominating centroid is transmitted. The code book is also sent over the wire so each 8-bit code can be translated back to a 24-bit pixel value representation. If the image of interest was of an ocean, we would expect many 24-bit blues to be represented by 8-bit codes. If it was an image of a human face, more flesh-tone colors would be represented in the code book."
