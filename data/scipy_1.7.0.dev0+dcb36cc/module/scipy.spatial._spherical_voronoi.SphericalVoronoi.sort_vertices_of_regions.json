For each region n, we choose the first triangle (=Voronoi vertex) in self._simplices and a vertex of that triangle not equal to the center n. These determine a unique neighbor of that triangle, which is then chosen as the second triangle. The second triangle will have a unique vertex not equal to the current vertex or the center. This determines a unique neighbor of the second triangle, which is then chosen as the third triangle and so forth. We proceed through all the triangles (=Voronoi vertices) belonging to the generator in points and obtain a sorted version of the vertices of its surrounding region."
