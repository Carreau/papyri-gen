A connected component at one level is parent of a component at a higher level if the latter is included in the first. A max-tree is an efficient representation of a component tree. A connected component at one level is represented by one reference pixel at this level, which is parent to all other pixels at that level and to the reference pixel at the level above. The max-tree is the basis for many morphological operators, namely connected operators."
